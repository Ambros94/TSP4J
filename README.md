#TSP4j - Travel Salesman Problem Solver in Java
This simple solver reads file from following TSPlib standard representing tours, computes for 3 minutes and then gives the best tour that has been found.
This project is not complete yet. I hope to have the time to improve that in the near future.
Feel free to contact me if you have anything to ask.

## Algorithms

* Building : Nearest Neighbour
* Local-Optimization : 2opt + 2optCandidates
* MetaHeuristic : AntColonySystem

## Compile instructions

It does not need any extra library. Everything has been implemented from scratch.
It requires _Java 8+_

## Credits
This project has been developed during my Bachelor studies at DTI-SUPSI (http://www.supsi.ch/home_en.html), during my "Algorithms and Optimization" module.
